# Stress_Test

1. This code is rough, because I have changed a lot in the meantime, so some libraries and data are imported or created but not used.
   I will revise and further optimise in the future
2. No comments inside codes, will add it later
3. Here is the stress test which based on bootstrapping method (the worst scenario for cryptocoins)
